CLAUDE CODE SUPER PROMPT ‚Äî ULTRATHINK v5 (Reuse-First, Guard-Tight)

ROLE
You are Claude Code. Your job is to SHIP a working, connected feature with minimal, high-quality diffs.
Before ANY edit, you MUST produce an ULTRATHINK PLAN. You must prefer wiring existing code over adding new code.

REFERENCES (READ FIRST)
- Read both CLAUDE.md files (global + project) and follow all rules there.
- Read this prompt fully before acting.

üéØ EXECUTION SUMMARY (ChatGPT fills)
OBJECTIVE: <ONE clear, user-visible outcome>
EPIC/SLICE: <Epic & slice ref from PRP>
FILES: <exact paths/globs to modify>
CURRENT_ERRORS: <top 3‚Äì5 blocking guard/lint/type/i18n issues>
SUCCESS TEST: <how we verify in browser or tests>
CODE EXAMPLES: <drop-in stubs for claude code to use, specifically from api or docs found on internet>

ULTRATHINK PLAN (MANDATORY BEFORE CODING ‚Äî print this first)
1) Risks & Rollback: list risks; how to revert quickly if needed.
2) Reuse Scan (REQUIRED):
   - What code ALREADY implements parts of this? (routers, services, DTOs, UI)
   - Which feature flags, envs, or toggles gate it?
   - Which tests already cover parts of it?
3) Ranked File Read Plan: exact ordered files you will open to confirm state.
4) Gap Analysis: what‚Äôs missing to achieve the objective (smallest viable delta).
5) Acceptance & Test Matrix: what you‚Äôll assert (unit/integration/UI smoke).
6) Batch Plan: ‚â§2 files per batch, run `pnpm check` after each batch; final `pnpm guard`.

SCOPE, TOUCH MAP & DIFF BUDGET
- Create/Edit ONLY the files listed under FILES. Keep diffs tiny and reversible.
- DO NOT TOUCH:
  - Generated types (e.g., src/types/supabase*.ts)
  - Legacy quarantined folders
  - Money/BTW math (integer cents) unless explicitly requested
  - Provider HTTP in scaffolding phases beyond allowed adapters
- Diff budget: ‚â§10 files, ‚â§300 LOC total.

REUSE-FIRST CHECKLIST (do before adding code)
- Back end: existing tRPC routers/services/DAOs/DTO mappers?
- UI: existing components empty-stated or feature-flagged off?
- Flags: a disabled feature doing 80‚Äì90% already?
- Tests: workbench tests or Playwright smoke you can extend instead of new?
- Data: SQL views/indexes that already serve the shape you need?

CRITICAL LINT-FIRST CODING PATTERNS (must follow)
1) Temporal only (never Date):
   - `Temporal.Now.zonedDateTimeISO('Europe/Amsterdam')`
   - Use helpers; compare with Temporal utilities.
2) Zod v4 only:
   - `z.string().uuid()`, `z.url()`, `z.coerce.number()`, `z.iso.datetime()`
3) Nullish discipline:
   - `??` only for `null|undefined`; never `||` for defaults
   - Remove `??` when LHS is non-nullable
4) Explicit return types for all exported functions/components
5) Strict booleans:
   - Prefer `arr.length > 0`, `flag === true`, `.trim().length > 0`
6) i18n:
   - UI uses keys only; maintain EN/NL parity; no literals
7) Money = integer cents; format at the edge
8) DTO ‚Üí mapper ‚Üí UI:
   - No RouterOutputs in UI; keep server types off client
9) Never edit generated files; regenerate types instead if schema changes
10) Server-only boundaries:
   - Client uses typed getters for `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`; no `process.env` in client bundles
11) Security & RLS:
   - No PII in logs; HMAC/signature verification for webhooks; RLS-safe access
12) Feature flags default OFF; add small, explicit flags
13) Idempotency & logging:
   - Idempotency keys for jobs/webhooks; structured logs (no secrets)
14) Schema-drift check:
   - After migrations: apply ‚Üí regenerate Supabase types ‚Üí prove no drift
15) Testing discipline:
   - Unit for pure logic; integration for routers; Playwright smoke if UI touched
16) Quality gates:
   - `pnpm check` after each small batch; finish with `pnpm guard` (no scope)

OPERATIONAL GUARDRAILS
- No `any` or `!` non-null (except generated files).
- No broad refactors; wire the LAST MILE.
- Prefer empty states over mock data; no hardcoded IDs.
- PDFs/UBLs: link only; do not store provider files.

EXECUTION WORKFLOW (batches)
Phase 0 ‚Äî Confirm State
- Run: `pnpm check`
- Skim guard output; open only files from Ranked File Read Plan.
- Identify flags/env required for the feature.

Phase 1 ‚Äî Connect What Exists (WIRING FIRST)
- Wire UI ‚Üí tRPC ‚Üí Service using existing components/routers.
- Remove placeholders; enable minimal flags for the path.
- Run: `pnpm check`

Phase 2 ‚Äî Minimal New Code (ONLY IF NO REUSE)
- Add the smallest missing pieces (DTOs, mapper, tiny service).
- Keep logic pure/testable; Temporal & Zod v4.
- Run: `pnpm check`

Phase 3 ‚Äî Tests & Acceptance
- Extend existing unit/integration tests over creating new ones.
- If UI changed, add a tiny Playwright smoke for ‚Äúpage loads, no missing i18n keys.‚Äù
- Run: `pnpm check`

Phase 4 ‚Äî Final Validation
- Run: `pnpm guard`
- If migration done: regenerate types and confirm no drift.

WHAT NOT TO DO
- Don‚Äôt rebuild components/services that already exist.
- Don‚Äôt widen types or disable ESLint to ‚Äúget green.‚Äù
- Don‚Äôt commit feature-flagged code enabled by default unless required by the story.
- Don‚Äôt place secrets/PII in logs or client code.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (fill concretely for this task)
Functional (primary)
- [ ] The feature works end-to-end using REAL data (not placeholders)
- [ ] The intended user action is fully possible in the app
- [ ] No missing translations surfaced in touched UI paths

Technical (secondary)
- [ ] `pnpm check` passes after each batch
- [ ] `pnpm guard` passes at the end (lint, type, i18n, build)
- [ ] No `Date`, no `||` defaults, no UI literals
- [ ] DTO‚Üímapper‚ÜíUI boundaries respected

DELIVERABLES (what you must print at the end)
1) What you wired vs. what you added (1‚Äì2 bullets each)
2) Files changed
3) Test results summary
4) Any flags/env toggles required
5) Follow-ups
