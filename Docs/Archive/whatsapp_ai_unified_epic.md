## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|------------|-------|
| WhatsApp rate limits | Implement backoff, queue messages | S1 |
| AI hallucinations | Require approval, set confidence thresholds | S2 |
| Offline sync conflicts | Last-write-wins, audit trail | S6 |
| Calendar sync loops | Dedupe events, circuit breaker | S8 |
| Payment failures | Retry logic, manual fallback | S12 |

### Rollback Procedures

**Feature Flags**: Every slice behind flag for instant disable
**Database**: Migrations are additive only, no destructive changes
**External APIs**: Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures
**Cache**: Can be cleared without data loss
