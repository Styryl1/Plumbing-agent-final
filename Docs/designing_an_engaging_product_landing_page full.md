Plumbing Agent One-Page Marketing Website – Product Requirements Document
Project Overview and Objectives

Plumbing Agent is a B2B SaaS product aimed at Dutch plumbing businesses. The goal is to create a single-page marketing website that clearly showcases the product’s value, builds trust, and drives visitors to take action (book a demo or contact via WhatsApp). The site must be extremely simple and user-friendly for non-technical users (busy plumbers), focusing on visual clarity and easy navigation. As a primary growth tool, the website should communicate the product’s value proposition clearly, build credibility, and guide visitors toward conversion
webstacks.com
. This document outlines the requirements for a production-ready one-page site, including content sections, functional and technical requirements, design guidelines, and suggested copy (in English, to be translated to Dutch later).

Target Audience

Primary Users: Dutch plumbing professionals and small business owners who may not be tech-savvy. They value practical solutions that save time and make their jobs easier.

Implications for Design: Use layman’s terms and plumbing business context; avoid jargon. Keep content clear, concise, and focused on benefits. Employ short sentences, simple words, headers, and bullet points to ensure anyone can understand the copy
contractingempire.com
.

User Goals: Instantly grasp what Plumbing Agent does and how it helps (e.g., scheduling jobs, managing invoices, communicating with customers). They should feel the site is speaking to their needs and be compelled to book a demo or reach out for more info.

Design Inspiration and Key Considerations

The design will draw inspiration from successful SaaS websites while tailoring the experience for plumbers:

Commusoft (Clarity & Structure): Emulate Commusoft’s clarity in messaging and structure. For example, Commusoft’s homepage uses a direct headline and subheader to state what the software is and who it’s for, paired with a prominent demo CTA
commusoft.co.uk
. We will similarly lead with a straightforward tagline and supportive text.

Hello Bonsai (Sectioning & Features): Follow a logical one-page flow like Bonsai, with well-defined sections (benefits, features, testimonials) and visually separated content blocks. Bonsai effectively presents features in grouped sections (e.g., “Work smarter by keeping everything in one place” followed by feature categories)
hellobonsai.com
hellobonsai.com
. Plumbing Agent’s features will be broken down into digestible sections with headings and brief descriptions.

Reflect.app & Make.com (Hero Design & Gradients): Utilize a modern hero section with an attractive gradient background for visual appeal. Reflect and Make use gradient accents in their hero designs to create a contemporary look and focal point. We will implement a green circular gradient theme as a brand element, aligning with the mint-green direction from Mintlify’s branding. This gradient can be a soft, mint-to-teal circular glow behind the hero content, giving the page a fresh and modern feel.

Contiant.com (Fluid Scrolling Experience): Ensure the page has a smooth, continuous scroll with intuitive flow between sections. Contiant’s site demonstrates how content can fluidly scroll on one page with engaging transitions. We will enable smooth scrolling for anchor links and consider subtle scroll-triggered effects to make moving through the page feel seamless (e.g. gentle content reveal on scroll). The scroll experience should feel natural and not “choppy” or disjointed.

Simplicity for Non-Technical Users: Above all, minimize complexity. Use large fonts for important text, ample white space, and straightforward layouts. Key information and CTAs should be immediately visible without requiring users to decipher complex graphics or long paragraphs. No heavy technical terminology – focus on how the product helps solve everyday problems (e.g., “Miss fewer appointments” instead of “Automated calendar integration”).

Visual Design & Branding Guidelines

Color Scheme: Primary color is a mint/green gradient (inspired by Mintlify’s design). This could be implemented as a gradient like mint green (#98FF99) to teal or blue-green, used in backgrounds, highlights, and CTA buttons. The gradient should convey a fresh, trustworthy vibe and high contrast on white text for readability.

Typography: Use clean, legible fonts (e.g., a sans-serif font that is friendly and modern). Headings should be bold and large; body text should be clear at a glance (consider slightly larger body font size for older audiences).

Imagery: Visual-first approach – include product screenshots (both desktop and mobile views) prominently near the top. For instance, Commusoft’s site places an overview image of their dashboard and mobile app in the hero
commusoft.co.uk
. We will prepare device mockups showing Plumbing Agent’s interface (e.g., a laptop with the dashboard, a phone with the mobile view) to immediately demonstrate the software’s look and feel. These images should be high-quality but optimized for web.

Icons: Use simple, universally-understood icons to accompany short benefit statements (e.g., a calendar icon for scheduling, a document icon for quotes/invoices, a chat bubble for customer communication). Icons should be line-based or filled with the brand color for consistency.

Layout: A single-column centered layout for most sections (to focus attention) with responsive adjustments for mobile (where content may stack). Keep consistent padding and spacing between sections to avoid visual clutter.

Brand Tone: Friendly, professional, and solution-oriented. The design should instill confidence (through professional visuals and testimonials) but also feel approachable (through simple language and helpful imagery).

Functional Requirements

The website will be a one-page continuous scroll landing page with distinct sections outlined below. There will be no separate subpages; all content resides on the main page, with a top navigation enabling scrolling to sections.

1. Header & Navigation

Sticky Header: A minimalist top bar that remains visible as users scroll (for easy access to CTAs). This header includes the company logo on the left and a primary CTA on the right.

Logo: Top-left placement. A simple text logo or minimal graphic representing Plumbing Agent. Clicking the logo scrolls back to top.

Navigation Links: Because it’s a one-page site, navigation may include anchor links to sections (e.g., “Benefits”, “Features”, “Testimonials”). However, to keep things simple, we may opt to omit a complex menu and rely mostly on scroll progression. If included, use 3-4 max menu items in plain language (and in Dutch when localized).

Primary CTA in Header: A “Book a Demo” button distinct from any menu items, styled in the brand’s green gradient or high-contrast color to stand out. This CTA should be visible at all times in the sticky header for quick access.

Mobile Header: On mobile devices, use a simple collapsed menu (hamburger icon) if necessary, but ideally keep just the logo and a single CTA button visible to reduce clutter.

2. Hero Section

Purpose: Immediately convey what Plumbing Agent is and encourage the user to take action. This is the first screen users see.

Background: Use a green circular gradient background element to create visual interest (e.g., a radial gradient behind the hero content or as a backdrop to the device images). This is inspired by modern SaaS heroes (Reflect.app, Make.com) that use gradients for a dynamic look.

Headline (H1): A clear, benefit-oriented statement about the product. For example: “Complete More Plumbing Jobs, With Less Hassle.” This headline should be concise and impactful, focusing on the main value (getting jobs done faster/easier). Commusoft’s headline “Complete more jobs, faster and easier” is a good reference for tone
commusoft.co.uk
.

Subheading (H2): One sentence (or two short sentences) explaining what the product is and who it’s for. E.g., “Plumbing Agent is an all-in-one platform that helps plumbing businesses schedule jobs, manage quotes & invoices, and keep customers happy – all in one place.” This mirrors Commusoft’s style of explicitly stating the software’s purpose and audience
commusoft.co.uk
. It should avoid jargon and emphasize simplicity (e.g., “all-in-one platform for plumbing businesses”).

Primary CTA Buttons:

“Book a Demo” – the main call-to-action, styled prominently (e.g., a bright green button). Clicking it should open a scheduling interface or contact form to set up a product demo. If possible, integrate a Calendly link or custom form for demo bookings.

“WhatsApp Chat” – a secondary but highly visible CTA, possibly styled as a plain text link or secondary button with a WhatsApp icon. On click, this triggers a WhatsApp deep link (using https://wa.me/YourNumber?text=Hello format) to initiate a chat. On mobile devices, this will open the WhatsApp app directly to send a message to the company. On desktop, it can open WhatsApp Web or prompt the user accordingly.

These two CTAs should be side by side (or one above the other on mobile). The demo CTA is primary, but the WhatsApp contact offers an immediate, informal way to reach out – which might appeal to plumbers who prefer quick messaging.

Hero Imagery: Show product screenshots in context:

A desktop screenshot of the Plumbing Agent dashboard (e.g., scheduling calendar or job list) displayed within a laptop or monitor mockup.

A mobile screenshot showing the app interface (perhaps job details or a mobile calendar) in a phone mockup.

These devices can be slightly angled or overlapping for a dynamic look, near the right side of the hero, while the text/CTAs are on the left (common layout for SaaS hero sections).

Ensure these images are easily visible and convey a modern, clean UI. They act as proof that “there’s a real product” and help users visualize using it.

Trust Indicators (Optional): If available, include a subtle row of client logos or accolades below the hero (e.g., “Trusted by [X] plumbing companies” or award badges). However, if the product is new and such logos are not established, this section can be omitted or replaced with a simple tagline about trust (e.g., “Built with Dutch plumbers in mind”).

Suggested Hero Copy:

Headline: “Complete More Jobs, Faster and Easier.”

Subtext: “The all-in-one software built for plumbing businesses – schedule jobs, send quotes & invoices, and manage your whole operation without the hassle.”

CTA Buttons: [Book a Free Demo] [Message Us on WhatsApp]

3. Key Benefits Section

Purpose: Highlight 3-4 top benefits of using Plumbing Agent in a quick, scannable way. This section convinces the user why they should care, by addressing common pain points.

Format: A simple horizontal or grid layout with an icon + short text for each benefit. For example, a 3-column layout on desktop (stacked on mobile).

Each Benefit Item:

Icon: e.g., a calendar with a checkmark, a clock, a money/bill icon, a chat bubble. Use a consistent style (monochrome icon in brand color or simple outline).

Benefit Title: a few words, bold. E.g., “Save Time on Scheduling”, “Get Paid Faster”, “Never Miss a Job”, “Delight Your Customers”.

Description: one short sentence explaining the benefit in practical terms. Keep it very concise and solution-focused. For example: “Automatically remind customers of appointments to reduce no-shows” or “Generate professional invoices in clicks and track payments easily.”

Tone: Keep text minimal and clear. Plumbers scanning the site should grasp these benefits within seconds. Avoid technical detail; emphasize outcomes (time saved, more revenue, less admin headache).

Design: Plenty of white space around each item. Possibly use subtle hover effects or minimal scroll animation (e.g., items fade-in or slide up gently as they come into view, to draw attention without being distracting).

Suggested Benefits & Copy:

“Stay Organized” – All your jobs and client details in one place. No more lost paperwork or missed appointments.

“Save Time” – Automate reminders and paperwork. Spend less time on admin and more on your actual work.

“Get Paid Faster” – Send quotes and invoices digitally and get paid quicker with online payments.

“Happy Customers” – Keep clients in the loop with automatic updates and professional communication.
(Note: Final benefits will be tailored to actual product features; these are examples.)

4. Feature Overview Section

Purpose: Provide a more detailed overview of key product features, showing how Plumbing Agent delivers the benefits above. This section can be structured similarly to Bonsai’s or Commusoft’s feature presentations, where each sub-section focuses on a specific capability with an accompanying image.

Structure: Divide into 2-3 feature blocks, each covering a major feature category:

Feature Block Example:

Title: e.g., “Job Scheduling & Calendar Management”

Description: a brief paragraph (2-3 sentences) explaining what this feature does and how it helps. For instance: “Drag-and-drop scheduling makes it easy to assign jobs to your team. See all your appointments in a color-coded calendar and send automatic reminders to customers
commusoft.co.uk
.”

Image: Show a screenshot specific to this feature (e.g., the scheduling calendar interface). Possibly presented inside a device frame or as a standalone image to the side of the text.

Repeat for other feature categories, such as “Quotes & Invoices” (creating quotes, converting to invoices, tracking payments) and “Customer Communication” (CRM, automated text/WhatsApp notifications, service reminders).

We can also consider a feature around “Mobile Access” if applicable (show the mobile app use cases).

Layout: Each feature block could alternate image placement (one with image on left, text on right; next with image on right, text on left) to create visual variety down the page. Ensure that on mobile, these collapse into image above text or vice versa in a logical order.

Copy Style: Focus on benefit-driven feature descriptions rather than technical specs. E.g., instead of “Calendar module with color coding and filter options,” say “Easily view and manage all your jobs on a color-coded calendar – so you never double-book or forget a job.”

Inspiration Details: For example, Commusoft highlights specific office and field tasks like job scheduling, tracking, invoicing, etc., with a short phrase and explanation
commusoft.co.uk
commusoft.co.uk
 – we will do similar, but streamlined for one-page. Hello Bonsai also presents features with brief headings like “Automations – Save time with automated workflows”
hellobonsai.com
; we can mimic that concise format for each feature.

Suggested Feature Blocks & Copy:

Job Scheduling & Alerts: “See all your appointments in one place and assign jobs with a click. Plumbing Agent’s calendar view helps avoid overlaps and sends automatic appointment reminders to customers, reducing no-shows.” (Image: job calendar UI)

Quotes & Invoicing: “Generate professional quotes and invoices on-site or in the office. Convert quotes to invoices in one tap and let customers pay online – get paid faster without chasing checks.” (Image: invoice creation UI)

Customer Management: “Keep a history of every customer and job. When a client calls, you have their past jobs, notes, and even photos at your fingertips. Give personalized service that builds trust.” (Image: customer profile UI or communication log)

(If applicable) Mobile App for Plumbers: “Use Plumbing Agent on the go. Check schedules, update job status, or send an invoice right from your phone while on-site. It works wherever you are, online or offline.” (Image: mobile app UI)
(These are example descriptions; actual features and text will be refined based on the real product capabilities.)

CTA Integration: Within or right after the feature section, insert a call-to-action banner: e.g., a centered statement “Ready to see how Plumbing Agent can transform your business?” with a “Book a Demo” button and “Or, chat on WhatsApp” link. This mid-page CTA ensures that after reading about features, the user is prompted again to take action (some users might not scroll back up to the hero CTA).

5. Demo & WhatsApp CTA Sections (Repeated)

Purpose: Reinforce conversion opportunities by repeating the CTAs at strategic points. The user should never have to scroll far to find a way to contact or proceed.

Mid-Page CTA Banner: After the features (or between major sections), include a full-width section with a standout background (possibly a lighter green gradient wash or an accent color) that draws attention. Content: “Interested in a closer look? Book a free 30-minute demo and see Plumbing Agent in action.” followed by a “Book a Demo” button. Also mention “Have questions? Chat with us on WhatsApp.” This section acts as a break between content-heavy sections, refocusing on conversion.

Placement: At minimum, have a CTA after the feature overview. If the page is long, we might also have one near the top (hero already has it) and near the bottom (above the footer). Essentially, a user finishing any section should see a next step.

Design: Should be highly visible but not intrusive. Using the brand gradient or a contrasting solid color can help it stand out. Possibly include a small relevant graphic (e.g., calendar icon or chat icon) next to text.

WhatsApp Link Behavior: The WhatsApp link in these CTAs should be obvious for mobile users (possibly show the WhatsApp icon + “WhatsApp Us”). Ensure the link uses the universal wa.me format for broad compatibility
faq.whatsapp.com
blog.short.io
. For example: https://wa.me/<phone>?text=Hi, I'm interested in Plumbing Agent demo. This pre-populated message makes it easy for the user – they just tap send.

Fallback Contact: In case a user doesn’t use WhatsApp, consider adding an email contact (like a mailto link) or a simple contact form in the footer. But the primary CTA remains WhatsApp and demo scheduling.

6. Testimonials Section

Purpose: Build credibility and trust by showing real-world positive experiences with Plumbing Agent. Social proof is especially important for convincing skeptics and highlighting the product’s benefits in an authentic voice.

Content: 2 to 3 short testimonials from beta users or early clients (ideally Dutch plumbing business owners). Each testimonial can include:

A quote (1-3 sentences) about how Plumbing Agent helped their business (focus on key pain points solved, e.g., saving time, improving organization, customer satisfaction).

Person’s name, and company name or role. If possible, include a small profile photo or company logo for authenticity.

Layout: Could use a carousel if more than 2 testimonials (so as not to take too much vertical space) or a simple side-by-side grid. Each testimonial is inside a card or quote box. For example, Hello Bonsai showcases multiple customer quotes in a slider with star icons
hellobonsai.com
hellobonsai.com
 – we can do something simpler since our audience might respond to direct quotes rather than star ratings.

Design Elements: Use quotation mark graphics or stylized formatting to set the quotes apart. Ensure text is legible (maybe italic or a slightly larger font for the quote). Keep background plain or a very light neutral color to focus on the text.

Example Testimonial Copy (to be replaced with real ones):

“Plumbing Agent has saved me hours of paperwork every week. My team and I can now schedule and track jobs from our phones – it’s so easy that even our most senior plumber uses it daily.” – John van Dijk, Owner, Van Dijk Plumbing

“We went from a messy calendar and missed appointments to a smooth operation. Customers love the quick quotes and we get paid faster. We simply could not run our business without Plumbing Agent now.” – Sofie Jansen, Co-owner, Jansen & Co. Plumbing

Note: If real testimonials are not yet available, design the section to be easily editable later. For launch, we might include placeholder text or a note like “[Your testimonial here – coming soon]” or simply omit this section with the intention to add once testimonials are gathered.

Trust Badges (Optional): If available, underneath testimonials or alongside them, show any ratings (e.g., if the product has a Capterra or Google review rating) or affiliations. But do not clutter – only include if meaningful and verified.

7. Footer

Purpose: Provide closing navigation, contact info, and any necessary legal links in a simple manner. It’s also another opportunity to present the WhatsApp and email contact for users who scroll to the end.

Content:

CTA (Condensed): A short line encouraging contact, e.g., “Questions or Ready to Get Started? <strong>Chat with us on WhatsApp</strong> or send us an email.” The WhatsApp deep link can be reused here, and an email mailto link (like mailto:info@plumbingagent.nl) can be provided as an alternative.

Links: Minimal footer menu – e.g., anchor links to top sections if useful (Home, Features, Contact). Possibly links to Terms of Service, Privacy Policy if those exist (important for GDPR compliance in NL, likely need a privacy policy link).

Social Media: If the company has Facebook or LinkedIn or other channels relevant to plumbers, icons could be included, but if not crucial, it can be left out to keep things simple.

Language Switch (Optional): Since content will be translated to Dutch, if we anticipate bilingual support, a small language toggle could be in the footer or header (EN/NL). But if the site will be Dutch-only for target users, skip this.

Copyright: A line like “© 2025 Plumbing Agent. All rights reserved.” in small text.

Design: Keep the footer background a contrasting color (perhaps dark gray or a darker green tone) to separate it from the body. Text in footer should be smaller but still readable. Use simple icons (e.g., WhatsApp icon, email envelope icon) next to contact methods for quick recognition.

Usability: Ensure that any contact links are clickable on mobile (phone numbers using tel: if added, WhatsApp as described, email with mailto:) so that tapping them works immediately.

Compliance: Include any required notices (cookie consent if needed – possibly a simple banner can handle cookies since it’s a one-page site; privacy link for GDPR as mentioned).

Technical Requirements

This site will be built using our in-house tech stack, ensuring maintainability and performance:

Framework: Use Next.js (React) for building the site. Next.js will allow for Server-Side Rendering or Static Generation of this landing page, which improves load performance and SEO. The one-page site can likely be exported as a static page for simplicity and hosted on a CDN for fast delivery.

Styling: Use Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development. Tailwind’s utility classes will speed up styling the gradient backgrounds, responsive layouts, and help maintain consistency. For example, we can easily apply the green gradient as a Tailwind utility (or custom CSS if needed for a radial gradient).

Interactive Elements: Use React for any interactive components:

The WhatsApp CTA is essentially a link (no special script needed, just ensure correct href format).

The “Book a Demo” button might open a modal or an embedded scheduler (if using a tool like Calendly, embed their widget script or use an iframe/modal).

If a contact form is used (not primary due to WhatsApp), we can integrate a form handling solution (e.g., an API route in Next.js or a third-party like Formspree) – but this can be decided based on whether email contact is needed in addition to WhatsApp.

Responsive Design: Must be fully responsive on all common device sizes. Plumbers and customers may view on mobile phones, so the layout should gracefully stack and be thumb-friendly:

Large tap targets for buttons.

Font sizes that are readable without zoom.

Images optimized for mobile (possibly using <picture> or Next.js <Image> component to serve different sizes).

Performance Optimization:

Implement image optimization (Next.js automatically optimizes served images). Use modern formats (AVIF/WEBP) for screenshots to reduce size without quality loss.

Lazy load below-the-fold images and sections. For example, hero content loads immediately, but images in the feature section or testimonials load as the user scrolls
bopdesign.com
. This reduces initial load time and saves bandwidth.

Use code splitting if any heavier scripts are used (though for a simple page, there should be minimal JS aside from what Next includes).

Ensure the page achieves a high Lighthouse performance score (aim 90+). With Next.js and minimal scripts, this is feasible. No large third-party libraries should be included unnecessarily.

SEO & Metadata:

Set up proper <head> tags: meta title and description (in Dutch, targeting keywords like “plumbing business software”, “plumber scheduling tool” in Dutch). The title might be "Plumbing Agent – Software for Plumbers" and description summarizing the offering.

Use semantic HTML5 sections (header, main, footer, section, etc.) to structure content logically – helps screen readers and SEO.

Optimize images with alt tags describing what’s shown (important for accessibility and also SEO).

If multilingual, configure hreflang tags (but likely initial launch is one language).

Analytics & Tracking: Include an analytics tool (e.g., Google Analytics or a privacy-friendly alternative) to track page visits, CTA clicks (demo button, WhatsApp link clicks). This will help in understanding conversion funnel. Since site is B2B, also consider setting up a Facebook Pixel or LinkedIn Insight tag if running ads to this page (if applicable for retargeting).

Accessibility: Follow basic a11y practices:

High color contrast (the green gradient and text should be tested for WCAG AA compliance; adjust shade if necessary to ensure readability).

Keyboard navigability (ensure you can tab through links and buttons).

ARIA labels for interactive elements if needed (like the mobile menu button).

Descriptive link text (no "click here", instead “Book a Demo” as link text).

Hosting & Deployment: The site can be deployed on Vercel (given Next.js) or our internal hosting, with SSL enabled (HTTPS). It should be reliable and globally accessible (though primary audience is Netherlands, ensure EU-based hosting for GDPR maybe).

In-House Maintainability: Since we use React/Next/Tailwind, the team should follow our internal coding standards:

Well-structured components (a component for Hero, for Feature, etc. to keep code organized).

Use Tailwind config for consistent design tokens (define the brand colors, etc.).

The codebase should be in a repository (Git) for version control, and CI/CD set up for automatic deployment on push.

No External Dependencies for Animation: If we add subtle animations, use CSS or small utility libraries rather than heavy animation libraries. Avoid jQuery or other legacy libraries entirely.

Form & GDPR: If any form is present (like an email capture or even the scheduling form), ensure compliance with GDPR: include a privacy notice or a checkbox if personal data is collected. However, since primary contacts are via WhatsApp and an external scheduling maybe, we might avoid storing data on the site itself (WhatsApp will handle that conversation, Calendly would handle scheduling data).

UX and Animation Best Practices

The site’s user experience should be smooth, modern, but not overdone with animations that could frustrate or confuse users. Here are the guidelines for UX enhancements:

Avoid Excessive Animations: Do not implement gratuitous fade-ins for every text or image on the page. Many B2B sites overuse fade or slide animations, which can slow down the user or cause them to miss content if it animates in late. Only use animations when they serve a purpose (e.g., drawing attention or indicating a transition)
bopdesign.com
.

Subtle Scroll-triggered Effects: It is acceptable to have subtle animations on scroll to create a sense of flow and engagement. For instance, as the user scrolls:

Benefit icons might appear with a gentle fade-up effect.

Feature images might slide in slightly from the side.

These animations should be fast (duration ~300ms) and trigger as soon as the element is in viewport, so the user almost doesn’t notice the effect – it should feel natural. The aim is to “provide seamless ease to the scroll – even if the animations are subtle”
bopdesign.com
.

No Parallax for Now: Parallax scrolling (different scroll speeds for background/foreground) can be visually impressive
bopdesign.com
, but to keep things simple and avoid potential performance issues, we likely will not use parallax effects. The focus is on content, not fancy backgrounds.

Microinteractions: Utilize small UI feedback animations:

Buttons should have hover states (e.g., slight color change or shadow) to show they are interactive.

If there’s any form field or interactive element, provide immediate feedback (e.g., highlight a field on focus).

These microinteractions help users know the site is responsive to their actions
webstacks.com
, making the experience feel polished without needing any heavy animation.

Visual Feedback on CTAs: When a user clicks “Book a Demo,” if it opens a modal or navigates, ensure there is a quick feedback (like the button could show a loading spinner if the scheduling form is loading). If WhatsApp CTA is clicked on desktop and nothing happens (if user doesn’t have WhatsApp Web), consider having a fallback message like “If WhatsApp does not open, you can message us at +31... or email example@company.com.” Possibly open a small tooltip or notice.

Smooth Scrolling for Anchor Links: If the top nav or any “scroll to top” links are used, enable CSS smooth scroll behavior. This allows the page to slide to the section instead of jumping abruptly, which contributes to the “fluid scroll” feel and helps users maintain context.

Prevent Animation Jank: All animations should be done using CSS transforms/transitions where possible (GPU-accelerated) to keep them smooth. Avoid heavy JS-based animations that could stutter on low-end devices. Test on common smartphones to ensure performance.

Consistency: Use the same animation style across similar elements. For example, all section headings might fade in the same way, or all images slide up gently. Consistency ensures the site feels cohesive and professional.

User-Control & Reduce Motion: Some users prefer reduced motion. We can respect the prefers-reduced-motion media query: e.g., disable non-essential animations if the user has that setting, so the content just appears with no movement. This is good practice and shows attention to accessibility.

Testing: Observe how actual users (or team members) react to the prototype. If anyone finds an animation distracting or unnecessary, be prepared to remove or tone it down. The site’s effectiveness comes first, which is to communicate and convert, not to show off animation skills.

Layout and Wireframe Guidance

Below is a high-level blueprint of the page layout with notes on content and design for each section. This is a guide for designers and developers to understand placement and hierarchy:

(Note: This will be described in text since we cannot draw here, but designers can create wireframes based on this description.)

Hero (Top Section):

Background: Full-width, light background with a circular green gradient focal point (e.g., centered behind the device images).

Left side (or centered on mobile): Headline (biggest text on page), subheadline (smaller, supporting text), and CTA buttons (Book Demo – as a prominent button, WhatsApp – as secondary style link/button).

Right side: Device mockup imagery showing the product (e.g., a laptop slightly rotated, with a phone in front of it).

Possibly an overlay or badge “Beta” or “New” if relevant, near the headline to indicate it’s modern/current (optional).

Spacing: ample padding top and bottom so it fills the screen nicely.

Benefits Section:

Likely a light grey or white background to distinguish from hero.

Three or four columns in a row (on desktop). Each column: icon at top center, benefit title below it (bold), description below that.

On mobile: these stack vertically with some spacing.

This section should be immediately visible or start just as one scrolls a little from the hero, to quickly present the value points.

Feature Overview:

Possibly split into two subsections for each category of features (if we have 3-4 categories, they might be grouped into two sections for better visual grouping).

Example layout for one feature subsection:

Left half: text (with a heading and 2-3 bullet points or a short paragraph).

Right half: an image (screenshot) illustrating the feature.

The next subsection could swap sides (image left, text right) to create an “alternating” pattern that’s visually interesting and feels like a narrative as you scroll.

Include a small heading or introduction for the feature section as a whole, e.g., “Key Features” or a catchy line like Bonsai’s “Work smarter by keeping everything in one place”
hellobonsai.com
. For Plumbing Agent maybe “Everything You Need to Run Your Plumbing Business” – centered above the feature blocks.

Use accent colors or graphics sparingly to highlight specific terms (for instance, bold or highlight the word “Automate” or “In one click” in text to draw attention).

CTA Banner (Mid-page):

Full width strip, perhaps with a subtle green gradient background to stand out.

Contains a short sentence + Book Demo button (and maybe the WhatsApp link).

Center this text and button(s). On mobile, ensure buttons are full-width or easy to tap.

This could have a slight shadow or a different layer to seem like a “callout”.

Testimonials:

Layout idea: a simple slider or three cards in a row.

If slider: show one testimonial at a time with left/right arrows or auto-rotate (but auto-rotate only if time is sufficient to read; or allow swipe on mobile).

If cards: three quote cards in one row on desktop (which could also auto-slide if more than 3 testimonials).

Each card: quote text and name (photo if available). Could use a light background or border.

Possibly a heading like “What Plumbers Are Saying” or “Customer Testimonials” at top of this section.

Footer:

Probably a dark background (dark green or charcoal) for contrast.

Divide into two or three columns on desktop:

One column: CTA text “Chat with us on WhatsApp” and the link, plus an email link.

Another column: maybe quick links (if any).

Another small column: social icons or nothing.

On mobile, these would stack or center. The WhatsApp CTA in footer on mobile could even be a large button spanning full width (“Message us on WhatsApp”).

Include the legal link (Privacy Policy) possibly as a single line at bottom.

Visual Flow: The user’s eye should be guided from top to bottom naturally:

Big heading → CTA at top → key benefits icons (which break up text nicely) → deeper info with feature images (to keep interest) → CTA reminder → social proof (testimonials) → final CTA in footer.
This sequence follows a common persuasive order (attention → interest → desire → action) akin to classic AIDA framework
contractingempire.com
contractingempire.com
:

Attention: Hero section grabs attention with bold claim and visuals.

Interest: Benefits and features maintain interest by addressing needs and showing capabilities.

Desire: Testimonials build desire/trust, showing real success stories.

Action: Frequent CTAs and the footer make taking action easy and urgent.

Throughout the layout, whitespace is crucial. Non-technical users should not feel overwhelmed, so we’ll err on the side of slightly larger sections with breathing room, rather than packing too much on one screen. This improves readability and clarity
contractingempire.com
 (small words, short sections, etc., as per the 4 C’s of clear copy).

Content and Copy Suggestions (English)

(The actual site will be in Dutch, but here we provide English copy that can later be translated. All copy is kept simple and benefit-focused.)

Below is a compilation of suggested text for each major section, incorporating the style and points discussed:

Hero:

Headline: “Complete More Jobs, With Less Hassle.”

Subheading: “Plumbing Agent is the all-in-one tool that helps you schedule jobs, send quotes & invoices, and keep your customers happy – easily and quickly.”

Button 1: “Book a Free Demo”

Button 2: “Chat via WhatsApp” (or “💬 WhatsApp Us” if using an icon and text).

Conclusion and Next Steps

This Product Requirements Document outlines a comprehensive plan for the Plumbing Agent marketing site. By focusing on simplicity, clear communication, and strong calls to action, the site is positioned to effectively convert visiting plumbers into leads.

Next Steps:

Design Phase: Create high-fidelity mockups based on these requirements. Ensure the gradient style and visual elements align with the branding direction. Iterate with feedback focusing on clarity and visual appeal.

Content Finalization: Gather any real testimonials, finalize the exact feature list and any data (for example, if we want to claim “X hours saved” or “Y plumbers onboard” as a statistic for credibility, gather that info). Translate the approved English copy to Dutch with a professional translator to maintain tone and simplicity.

Development: Implement the design in Next.js and Tailwind, following the technical and UX guidelines above. Ensure to test on multiple devices and browsers (including older phones that some users might have).

Testing: Conduct user testing with a few non-technical people (ideally someone in a trades business) to see if the site is intuitive. Also test the WhatsApp link and demo booking flow thoroughly.

Optimization: Run performance and SEO audits (Lighthouse, etc.) and address any issues (like large asset sizes or missing alt tags).

Launch: Deploy the site and monitor analytics for user behavior. Be ready to make adjustments (e.g., if many people click WhatsApp but drop off, maybe the pre-filled message needs tweaking or the phone number might be wrong, etc., or if demo clicks are low, maybe the CTA text or placement needs refinement).

By adhering to this PRD, the resulting one-page site will be modern, fast, and effective – giving Plumbing Agent a strong online presence that appeals to its target audience and converts interest into action. Every element, from the green gradient hero to the WhatsApp chat button, is designed with the plumber’s experience in mind, ensuring that the technology feels approachable and beneficial.
